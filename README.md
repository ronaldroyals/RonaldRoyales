**`Junior Software Developer`**

Hello. I am a junior software developer looking to broaden my knowledge and improve my skills regarding software development for fun and practical purposes. Even though most of my code is not built from the ground up, I am still proud to say that all of the programs stored here all work as intended. And through all the debugging and probelm solving, managed to learn the purpose and functionality of each program and how they can be utilized in the real-world.
